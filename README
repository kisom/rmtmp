[ rmtmp: remove temporary files ]

I was prototyping a project that was creating a temporary file for
every second in a certain time range of timestamps, running through
about 4500 timestamps / second. However, I managed to forget to clean
up those temporary files, leaving me with over three million temp files
in my /tmp. find(1) was taking entirely too long at about 300 files per
minute, so while it was running, I hacked together a custom utility
in C to do it much faster. It removed about two million files in under
five minutes.

In short, rmtmp(1) steps through the directory entry for /tmp. When it
finds a regular file, it checks to see if it starts with the prefix
passed in; if so, that file is removed.

This is a fairly trivial utility that took about fifteen minutes to
write, and it's aimed at a specific use case. It is being distributed
in the offchance others find it useful.


usage:
	rmtmp <prefix>

for example, if your program has called mkstemp("myprogXXXXXX"):
	rmtmp myprog
will remove all of the temporary files generated.
